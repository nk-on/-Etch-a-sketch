# Etch-A-Sketch Project
Project Overview

The Etch-A-Sketch project is designed to create a dynamic grid that allows users to draw and interact with it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project includes several key features to enhance the user experience.

# Features 

## 1. Dynamic Grid Generation

Users can specify the size of the grid they want, ranging from 1X1 to 64X64. The grid dynamically adjusts to the specified size, providing flexibility and customization.

## 2. Interactive Drawing

The grid squares react to user interaction, filling with the chosen color when hovered over. Users can easily draw by hovering the mouse over the squares, creating a responsive and engaging experience. Interactive drawing is activated by default and  can be activated when clicking on "color mode".

## 3. Rainbow Mode

For a playful touch, users can activate the rainbow mode by clicking on "Rainbow mode", causing the squares to fill with random rainbow colors. This feature adds a creative and visually appealing element to the drawing experience.

## 4. Eraser Functionality

The project includes an eraser button that allows users to erase individual squares. 

## 5. Clear Entire Board

To provide a quick way to start anew, users can click on the clear button to erase the entire board. This feature is useful for users who want to reset their drawing and begin a new creation.
